# Sherlog Holmes

*Less data containing useful information is way better than lots of data containing a mess.*

Don't you hate those thousands of lines in a log blowing up with your troubleshooting? Lots of useless data that you have to filter just to turn that 300 MB of madness into a 30 KB of useful information? If you need something that can rip off useless entries so you can have a clue about what is going on with that application, you should give Sherlog Holmes a try.

If you are a log detective, then Sherlog Holmes is your best companion!

## Installation

Sherlog can be installed easily through the `gem` command:

```sh
$ gem install sherlog-holmes
```

This is the preferable way since Sherlog is basically a console line application. Of course you can add it to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sherlog_holmes'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

## How it works

Sherlog works by grabbing every line of an input and applying a Regular Expression to create an `entry`. This `entry` will be filtered based on a set of given rules and, if it is accepted, will be passed to a set of defined processors so they can do something useful (like printing the output so you can redirect it to a sane log file).

The attributes are based on the named capture groups:

- Time: `time`
- Level: `level`
- Category: `category`
- Origin: `origin`
- Message: `message`

```regexp
(<?level>\w+)\s(<?category>\s+)\s(<?message>.+)
```
*Any other capture group will be assigned to a set of custom attributes and can be used later.*

Patterns for exception and stacktrace should be defined separately. The exception pattern is used only in the message field and stacktraces. Here is a complete example of a pattern configuration:

```yaml
jboss:
  entry: (?<time>[0-9,.:]+)\s+(?<level>\w+)\s+\[(?<category>\S+)\]\s\((?<origin>[^)]+)\)?\s?(?<message>.+)
  exception: (?<exception>\w+(\.\w+)+(Exception|Error))
  stacktrace: ^(\s+at)|(Caused by\:)|(\s+\.{3}\s\d+\smore)
```

The configuration should contain a unique id and at least a pattern for the log **entry**. Place you configuration file in a `*.yml` file inside your `$HOME/.sherlog/patterns` directory and you're ready to go!

### Configuration Inheritance

You can create a base configuration and then override some values to create another one. In this case, you need to specify the parent configuration with the `from` key:

```yaml
base.java:
  exception: (?<exception>\w+(\.\w+)+(Exception|Error))
  stacktrace: ^(\s+at)|(Caused by\:)|(\s+\.{3}\s\d+\smore)
jboss:
  from: base.java
  entry: (?<time>[0-9,.:]+)\s+(?<level>\w+)\s+\[(?<category>\S+)\]\s\((?<origin>[^)]+)\)?\s?(?<message>.+)
```

## Usage

Shelog Holmes provides the command line tool `sherlog`. You can use this to pass a log, the filters you need to apply and the process that needs to be executed (like showing the filtered entries or counting the exceptions):

### Config Options

`-p, --patterns FILE`

Additionally to having definitions in your `$HOME/.sherlog` directory, you can pass a definition file from anywhere in your machine and Sherlog will scan and register the definitions.

`--encode ENCODE`

This sets the encode to use while reading the log file.

`-t, --type TYPE`

This will manually set the patterns definitions. If you don't specify this option, Sherlog will try to guess the pattern by trying the mapped ones until it finds a match.

### Filter Options

`-c, --category EXPRESSION`

This will filter entries using the category field. You can use the wildcard `*` here.

`-l, --level EXPRESSION`

This will filter entries using the level field. You can use the wildcard `*` here.

`-o, --origin EXPRESSION`

This will filter entries using the origin field. You can use the wildcard `*` here.

`-m, --message EXPRESSION`

This will filter entries using the message field. You can use the wildcard `*` here.

`-e, --exception EXPRESSION`

This will filter entries using the exception field. You can use the wildcard `*` here.

*NOTICE: the expressions are case sensitive, wildcards can be used at start, end or both*

`--any-exception`

This will filter entries with exceptions, regardless the kind.

`-f NAME, --field NAME`

This will filter entries using custom attributes found in named capture groups. This parameter specifies the custom attribute name. Use it with `-v | --value` for defining the expression.

`-v EXPRESSION, --value EXPRESSION`

Specifies the expression to use with the last `-f | --field` parameter. The wildcard `*` is accepted here.

### Logical Options

`--and`

This will use the **AND** operation to connect the next filter. This is the default operation.

`--or`

This will use the **OR** operation to connect the next filter.

`--not`

This will negate the next filter.

```
sherlog --level WARN --or --not --level INFO --and --any-exception
```

This is equivalent to:

    (WARN || ! INFO) && EXCEPTION

*NOTICE: try not to do fuzzy logics with those operators*

### Operation Options

`--print`

This will instruct Sherlog to print every filtered entry. This is useful to reduce that crazy log file into a sane one.

```
$ sherlog --level ERROR --print crazy-log-file.log > sane-log-file.log
```

`--no-stacktrace`

This will instruct Sherlog to not print stacktraces for entries. This only has effect if used with `--print`.

`--count GROUPS...`

Set this and Sherlog will count the number of entries per level, category, origin or exception. The possible parameters are (separated by a `,`):

- `levels`: counts the number of entries per level
- `categories`: counts the number of entries per category
- `origins`: counts the number of entries per origin
- `exceptions`: counts the number of entries per exception
- `all`: counts all groups

```
$ sherlog --count levels,categories log-file.log
```

*Don't forget to set an operation or `sherlog` will not show anything in your console!*

## Built-in Patterns

Currently, Sherlog has the following patterns:

- `base.java`: base pattern for Java outputs (contains patterns for exceptions and stacktraces only)
- `jboss`: matches Wildfly | EAP logs
- `jboss.fuse`: matches JBoss Fuse logs
